# 50 JavaScript Projects

This repository contains 50 mini JavaScript projects built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.

These projects were part of my learning journey to strengthen my skills in DOM manipulation, events, functions, and UI building. Most were built by following online tutorials and courses.

## Note

Most of these projects were inspired by tutorials such as the [50 Projects in 50 Days](https://github.com/bradtraversy/50projects50days) course by **Brad Traversy**.  
They were created for educational purposes and to help me grow as a developer.
